positive
    how the government controls our spending

negative
    role in setting monetary policy. by keeping intrest rates low for a long poeriod of time. the fed incentivised many investors to engage in speculative investments that inflated prices.

    


my position
    positive because the fed reserve is an important intuition in the economy. and the positives outweigh the negatives.
